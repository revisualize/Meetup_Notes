Notes from the 29th Seattle Hacker News Meetup on June 3, 2014

Speaker: Andrea Moro, VP of Product at DoubleDown Interactive
Synopsis: Lessons learned in making products people will pay for.

- Primary Motivators: Power (Control/War/Conquer/Destruction), Affiliation (Nurturing/Build Relationships - even subconsciously), Achievement (Goal, Rank, Score)
- High Frequency Loops: 1, 2, 3, 5 minute loops; quick turn around. Example: quick play on the bus or toilet [Don't judge. You can monetize toilet time.]
- Temptation Moments: Track user interaction and offer assistance for advancement for nominal fee. Example: Play has hit a nerve, player is struggling. Offer a token to ease or complete the accomplishment after 'x' number of tries. Find ways to reduce conversion friction.
- Anticipation of winning is better than winning.
- Usability -> Cognitive Load: Build Relationships - Design and Cater Relationship growth with the user(s). Reduce mental fatigue, friction and stress. Create minor stress moments within interaction and offer temptation modifiers.

Side Notes:
Someone mentioned 'list of cognitive biases' and Steve Yegge
Try not to completely scrap projects. Find ways to make projects modular. This allows code, ideas, or whatever to be reused and/or re-purposed.If a project is struggling. Curb the project for a week or two then re-engage with the project. This may cause a new viewpoints or allow for a pivot.

Research Notes: (I've added these after the talk.)
